# Luna

**A desktop AI companion that lives with you — she remembers, perceives, acts, and speaks.**

An LLM brain with layered memory and dreams, proactive agency, action-integrity rails, and a
code-agent capability — embodied as a Live2D avatar with lip-synced custom voice.

<sub>The demo is the real front end and rendering engine on a scripted tape — her actual voice, pre-rendered,
in English or in Chinese (the same scenes; pick at the door).
What differs from the app sits around her, not in her: the lines are typed for you (you only press ➤),
a scene pill carries Next, and a curtain marks each skip in time.</sub>

<sub>This repository is the <b>engineering, published as a reference</b> — not a distributed product.<br/>
There are no installers: Luna is one person's companion, and the instance that matters lives on one
machine. Read the code, clone it, take the parts you want.</sub>

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Three-layer memory + dreams** — a rolling working window, salience-scored durable turns, and
  structured long-lived facts over one SQLite file; an offline **dream cycle** consolidates the day
  into facts, diary, and distilled skills. Hybrid recall blends embeddings, keywords, recency, and a
  relevance floor so a decisively relevant old memory is never buried.
- 🌱 **Proactive agency** — she can open a conversation herself: silence-aware timing ladders,
  weather-shift and reconnect hooks, follow-up thoughts — all behind deterministic, tunable rails
  (quiet hours, outreach intensity) instead of a "message me every N minutes" loop.
- ⚡ **Streaming everything** — one WebSocket, one Zod-typed event contract shared by server and web.
  Reply tokens, tool starts/progress, memory updates all stream live; tool turns never block.
- 🛠 **Real capabilities** — web search + SSRF-guarded page reading, weather (QWeather / Open-Meteo),
  time perception, a gated code-agent (repo map, symbol search, edits), and a skills shelf she
  distills herself.
- 🎭 **Embodied** — a Live2D avatar with emotion-driven expressions, gaze follow, idle animation
  profiles, phoneme lip-sync, and a transparent always-on-top **desktop pet mode**.
- 🗣 **Her voice** — a GPT-SoVITS cloned voice, set up with no
  terminal anywhere: the wizard downloads & deploys the runtime in one click, you drag a voice pack
  in, and Luna starts + supervises the voice server herself. Drop a new pack onto the running app
  to swap voices.
- 🧙 **Guided onboarding** — a bilingual (中文/English) wizard that opens by asking which Luna you
  want: **the complete companion** (Live2D + voice, seven steps) or **just the agent core** (chat box
  only, five steps, nothing to download). Either way you get *live* key validation against the real
  vendors, drag-and-drop avatar/voice installs, and escape hatches everywhere (status-bar button,
  native `⌘,` menu, failure dialogs) so a bad config can never strand you.
- 🔒 **Local-first** — memory is a local SQLite file, keys live in a local config only, the server
  binds loopback by default. Nothing about *her* leaves your machine.

## 🚀 Run your own

There is no installer to download — you build her from source, which is also the honest way to read
what she is.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Alan-Yu-2077/Luna.git
cd Luna
bun run app        # installs deps → builds → packages → puts Luna.app on your Desktop → launches
```

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/wizard-chat.png" width="640" alt="The bilingual guided setup wizard" /><br/>
<sub>First launch opens a bilingual guided setup — no env files, no docs required.</sub>
</div>

The only *required* thing is a chat API key (Anthropic, or any compatible gateway) — every other
step is optional and re-runnable from Settings.

Prefer the browser, or not on macOS?

```sh
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
bun run dev            # server + web at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🏗 How it fits together

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/assets/architecture-overview.svg" width="900" alt="A conceptual diagram of Luna as an agent harness. At the centre is the LLM, drawn as a stateless black box that takes one array of messages in and emits a token stream plus tool-call intents out. To its left, the context assembled fresh for every call: cached identity, retrieved recall, volatile perception, and the recent window. To its right, the output and what is done with it: words, tool calls, silence, and an integrity gate. Below, three return loops carry state across calls — tool results rejoining the same request, the exchange being persisted into luna.sqlite and recalled later, and an offline dream pass in which the same box re-reads and rewrites that store." />

<sub>The model is the one part nobody here wrote. Everything else is a decision about what it may see,
what it may do, and what survives to the next call.</sub>

</div>

Five Bun workspace packages with a one-way dependency arrow: [`protocol`](packages/protocol) (the
shared wire contract — a wire change that isn't reflected on both sides is a *compile error*),
[`server`](packages/server) (the brain; owns all state and model calls),
[`web`](packages/web) (a thin reactive view), [`music-cli`](packages/music-cli) (a vendored
macOS Now-Playing observer), and [`desktop`](packages/desktop) (an optional
Electron shell). The deep dive lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

<sub>The live version pans, zooms, traces a single relationship, and exports — every box also carries the
source file it was drawn from, pinned to a commit.</sub>

## 🎬 Moments

Real conversations — she jokes, she looks things up, she reads her own codebase, she remembers.

## 📚 Documentation

**Reading this as a reference?** Start with [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the shape, then
[`docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md) — 140+ per-version entries, each split
into *Fact* (what changed) and *Inference* (why it mattered), including the versions that were wrong
and the gaps that were never closed. That log, not this README, is the honest account of how she got
built.

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) | Bring-your-own model & voice, step by step (the wizard does this for you) |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | The structural map: packages, wire contract, memory, tools, proactive rails |
| [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) | Where things are heading, by theme |
| [`docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md) | The full per-version engineering log (130+ entries) |
| [`.env.example`](.env.example) | Every configuration knob, documented |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Dev workflow, tests, conventions |

## 🧪 Development

```sh
bun test                                  # the whole suite, all packages
bun run --cwd packages/server tsc --noEmit  # per-package typecheck (server/web/desktop/protocol)
```

Tests live next to the code (`*.test.ts`), the wire contract is `as`-free, and every risky feature
lands behind a default-off env flag before its default flips. The server binds
**loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default**; set `LUNA_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` only on a trusted network.

## 🤝 Using this code

This is a personal project published as a reference, not a supported product — **no promises about
issues, PRs, or platform support.** That's the deal, and it's meant generously: the code is MIT, the
per-version reasoning is all in [`docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/history/DEVELOPMENT.md), and
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents the conventions if you're forking or reading closely.
Take what's useful; you don't owe anything back.
